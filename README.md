# Unit-Converter
Unit converter android app created by Kyle Hanson.

The Unit Converter app receives an input value from the user, along with specified units selected from a dropdown menu. Afterwards, the user selects the units to be converted to from another dropdown menu. While you can choose any of the available units in the input unit dropdown menu, the output unit dropdown menu only displays those that are related to the input unit selected. For example, units of length (in) will be able to be converted to other units of length (ft, yd, cm, etc.), but won't display unconvertable units like units of temperature or volume. Once the "Convert" button is pressed, the output value changes from blank to the converted value using the conversion formula between the two units. 

When designing the app layout itself, I from the too compact design labeled as d1

and switched to the more aesthetically pleasing design labeled as d2.
